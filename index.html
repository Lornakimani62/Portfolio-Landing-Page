        <p>I have recently just completed my Bachelor's degree course in <span class ="bold">Computer science</span> and as I wait to graduate I decided to join <a href="https://moringaschool.com">Moringa school</a> to sharpen my skills in programming. I would like to describe myself as a multidisplinary, results orientented and passionate individual. I enjoy travelling, listening to music and meeting new people.Web and software development is not a new concept and I have completed the following projects while at moringa.
